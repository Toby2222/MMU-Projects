                <!-- add your 150 word maximum About Me content here -->
                <p>I am an 18 year old student, working at Barclays as a Technical Delivery Manager and completing a degree in Digital and technology solutions. I grew up near Knutsford and went to a local primary school for two years. I started going to the Grange school in Cheshire, joining in prep 3 as it was called at the school. I stayed at the school for 11 years, all the way up through sixth form. I was happy with my time at the grange and did well out of it. I have been lucky enough to have travelled to many different countries, from road trips across the Canadian Rockies to building houses in Uganda. My most recent trip was to Italy where my family and I spent time experiencing the culture.</p>

                <p>I want to talk about travelling, one my aims in life is to visit all 7 continents. So far I have visit 6 of the 7, I am yet to visit Antarctica. I have visited nearly twenty countries and I hope to continue travelling during my adult life. My favourite part of travelling is seeing the different environments and landscapes, the variety and beauty of different parts of the globe. One of the best experiences I had when travelling was when I spent three months living in Norway, going to school there and experiencing the local culture. The landscape in Norway is so beautiful and I would love to live there when I am older. In Spring 2019 I when to Uganda to visit the family and the school that we as a family help to sponsor. It was a truly eye-opening experience that really made me appreciate everything a lot more. Even more recently I went to Italy and spent many hair-raising hours sat in close passing cars on windy rounds climbing mount Vesuvius. I loved my visit to Italy visiting the tourist attractions and being able to explore the local towns. One of the best attractions I visited was Pompeii, which was astonishingly large, it was a surreal experience to walk those streets.</p>
